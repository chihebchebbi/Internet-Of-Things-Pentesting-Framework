[-] Implement two-factor authentication where possible
[-] Ensure password recovery mechanisms are secure
[-] Ensure that users have the option to require strong passwords
[-] Ensure that users have the option to force password expiration after a specific period
[-] Ensure that users have the option to change the default username and password

 [-] Ensure the device is produced with a minimal number of physical external ports (e.g. USB ports)
 [-] Ensure the firmware of Operating System can not be accessed via unintended methods such as through an unnecessary USB port
 [-] Ensure the product is tamper resistant
 [-] Ensure the product has the ability to limit administrative capabilities in some fashion, possibly by only connecting locally for admin functions 
 [-] Ensure the product has the ability to disable external ports such as USB
